BLConsole is a class to be instantiated by your iOS project, which
starts up a small telnet server, as well as Bonjour services so
that it is discoverable on the local network.

The basic concept is that rather than your game pulling up a console
on the iDevice's screen, and having to deal with the on screen
keyboard, or building a user interface for debugging or user
customizations, you instead will connect from another device,
presumably with a better keyboard and display for this kind of
thing.

There is an example application that includes the class, and shows
basic use for it.

It will start up a listner on port 24242, incrementing it in case
that port is already occupied for whatever reason.

When you telnet to your device on this port, you will be greeted 
by a console prompt 

>: 

From there, if you type 'help' it will list the available commands.
